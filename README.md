# portfolio

I'm refactoring this portfolio site to use react and redux.
I plan to have a blog, a project section and an about me.
I will use heroku to deploy the frontend and backend.
I copied over the .gitignore content from sluggram frontend.

To create a package.json file type this in terminal within the frontend directory:
`npm init`

To create nodemodules (and subsiquently a package-lock.json file):
`npm install`
